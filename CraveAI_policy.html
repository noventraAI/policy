  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 2025-08-16</p>
  <p><strong>Company:</strong> Noventra AI Ltd. (“CraveAI”, “we”, “our”, “us”)</p>
  <p><strong>Contact:</strong> <a href="mailto:noventraai2025@gmail.com">noventraai2025@gmail.com</a></p>

  <h2>1. Overview</h2>
  <p>This Policy explains what data we collect when you use the CraveAI mobile app on iOS or Android (the “Service”), how we use and share it, and your choices. By using the Service, you agree to this Policy.</p>

  <h2>2. Data We Collect</h2>
  <h3>2.1 Content You Provide</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Photos:</strong> We do not store photos you upload for analysis. They are processed transiently and discarded after results are generated. Only the <em>AI-generated meal outputs</em> (e.g., recipes, food images) are stored in your account history.</li>
    <li><strong>Voice Inputs (Crave Mode):</strong> When you use voice to describe cravings, your audio is securely transmitted to AI providers for processing. We do not store raw recordings; only the final interpreted meal suggestions are kept.</li>
    <li><strong>Text Inputs:</strong> Cravings, dietary preferences, or other prompts you enter. Stored only as part of your meal history.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>2.2 Account & Purchase Data (if applicable)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Account:</strong> Email or login identifier if you create an account.</li>
    <li><strong>Purchases:</strong> Subscription status, receipts, and entitlement data from the platform store (Apple/Google) and our subscription provider (e.g., RevenueCat). We do not receive your full payment card details.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>2.3 Usage & Diagnostics (non-personal where possible)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>App interactions, device type, OS version, crash logs, and performance metrics used to improve stability and features.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. How We Use Data</h2>

    <li>Verify purchases, manage subscriptions and entitlements.</li>
    <li>Communicate important changes to the Service or this Policy.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. AI Processing & Model Training</h2>
  <p>We use third-party AI and infrastructure providers to process your inputs solely to generate results you requested. <strong>We do not use your photos, voice, or text to train AI models.</strong></p>

  <h2>5. Third-Party Service Providers</h2>
  <p>We use trusted processors to deliver the Service; they act on our instructions and do not sell your data.</p>

    <li><strong>Storage & backend:</strong> e.g., Supabase for secure hosting and databases.</li>
    <li><strong>Subscriptions:</strong> e.g., RevenueCat to manage entitlements (plus Apple App Store / Google Play for billing).</li>
    <li><strong>Diagnostics/analytics:</strong> crash/usage telemetry to improve reliability (no ads tracking).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. Data Storage, Retention & Security</h2>

    <li><strong>Retention:</strong> 
      <ul>
        <li>Generated meal outputs: kept in your account history until you delete them or request deletion.</li>
        <li>Purchase/entitlement and diagnostic logs: typically retained up to <strong>24 months</strong> unless longer is required for fraud prevention, accounting, or legal obligations.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Security:</strong> Access controls, least-privilege practices, and monitoring to reduce unauthorized access risks. No system is perfectly secure.</li>
