    <li>When you submit a photo for design rendering, it is uploaded to a third-party AI service (e.g., OpenAI, Stability AI) to generate a photorealistic result.</li>
    <li>These images are used only for the purpose of generating previews and are not stored on our servers after processing.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>b. Item Uploads or Product Links</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>You may upload images of furniture or paste product links. These are also transmitted temporarily to generate the requested design.</li>
